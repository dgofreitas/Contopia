# /scaffold — Project Foundation Setup

Delegates to **SystemArchitect** to analyze NFRs, propose the tech stack, and scaffold the initial project structure.

## Usage

```
/scaffold [description or context]
```

## When to Use

- Starting a new project from scratch (no `package.json`, no build files)
- Need to define: language, framework, database, infra topology
- After PO created epics/NFRs, before PM creates stories (or after)

## Workflow

1. **Invoke SystemArchitect**:
   ```
   task(subagent_type="SystemArchitect", description="Define stack and scaffold", prompt="Analyze NFRs and propose tech stack for: $ARGUMENTS")
   ```

2. **SystemArchitect will**:
   - Read `docs/product/NFRS.md` + `docs/product/VISION.md`
   - Analyze technical requirements from NFRs
   - Propose complete tech stack with rationale
   - ⏸️ GATE #SA: await your approval
   - After approval: create `docs/architecture/TECH-STACK.md`
   - Scaffold initial project structure
   - Document decisions in `context/project/`

## Output

- `docs/architecture/TECH-STACK.md`
- `context/project/technical-domain.md` (filled)
- `context/project/decisions-log.md` (stack decision recorded)
- Initial project scaffolding (directories, config files)

## Next Step

After scaffold, run `/story` or `/plan EPIC-XXX` to proceed with the backlog.
